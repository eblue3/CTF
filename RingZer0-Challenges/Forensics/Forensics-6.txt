"EvilCorp claiming that they hacked the RingZer0 Team website can you prove it?"
=> I have to find somewhere to reveal that EvilCorp had hacked RingZer0, that's my first thought
=> Searching all along some website which has proof of owner, or analytics, nothing is found

Then i remember the snapshot website: archive.org
=> I go through it with ringzer0ctf.com
=> Nothing good appears.

Then i just remember the old domain of the website. LOL
=> archive.org search again for ringzer0team.com
The Hack of Mr.Robot to E-Corp is on 1995 => So i search in 2015 only.
Then in Dec/19, there're 2 snapshots => 1 contains FLAG:

FLAG-j15emFQ81aWC2fGA81g4dp967WM4m0Sv
=> BINGO !
