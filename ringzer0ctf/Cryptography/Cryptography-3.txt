-- File recovery --

Step-by-Step:
1: Download & extract the tar file.
2: Go to the extracted folder.
3: Use this command:
openssl rsautl -decrypt -inkey private.pem -in flag.enc
=> FLAG-vOAM5ZcReMNzJqOfxLauakHx [This is the FLAG]

Explaination: The flag.enc is encrypted with RSA. "private.pem" contains the Key to decrypt it and we used the command to decrypt "flag.enc" with key in "private.pem".
