Instructions

    Take *ingredient* from refrigerator. — read an integer from standard input and store it into the given variable.
    Put *ingredient* into [nth] mixing bowl. — push the value of the variable on the top of the bowl. Here and from now on skipping the index of the bowl or dish or the reference to it completely means that there is only one bowl or dish in use.
    Fold *ingredient* into [nth] mixing bowl. — pop the top element from the bowl and store it in the variable.
    Add *ingredient* [into [nth] mixing bowl]. — add the value of the variable to the top element of the bowl.
    Remove *ingredient* [from [nth] mixing bowl]. — subtract the value of the variable from the top element of the bowl.
    Combine *ingredient* [into [nth] mixing bowl]. — multiply the top element of the bowl by the value of the variable.
    Divide *ingredient* [into [nth] mixing bowl]. — divide the top element of the bowl by the value of the variable.
    Add dry ingredients [to [nth] mixing bowl]. — add up the values of dry ingredients and push them on the top of the bowl.
    Liquefy *ingredient*. — change the type of the variable to liquid.
    Liquefy contents of the [nth] mixing bowl. — change the type of all values in the bowl to liquid.
    Stir [the [nth] mixing bowl] for *N* minutes. — move the top element of the bowl N positions down, and all elements above it — one position up.
    Stir *ingredient* into the [nth] mixing bowl. — execute Stir using the value of ingredient as N.
    Mix [the [nth] mixing bowl] well. — shuffle the elements of the bowl.
    Clean [nth] mixing bowl. — delete all elements of the bowl.
    Pour contents of the [nth] mixing bowl into the [pth] baking dish. — copy the elements from the bowl to the dish, preserving their order and putting them on top of the elements which have already been in the dish.
    *Verb* the *ingredient*. — beginning of loop. Loop continues as long as the value of loop counter ingredient is non-zero. Any verb can be used to mark the loop.
    *Verb* [the ingredient] until *verbed*. — end of loop. Must use the same verb as beginning of the loop. If the ingredient is present, its value is decremented. Note that this ingredient doesn’t have to be the loop counter.
    Set aside. — break loop.
    Serve with *auxiliary-recipe*. — invoke cooking of auxiliary recipe. Execution of the calling recipe is paused until the auxiliary one is done.
    Refrigerate [for *N* hours]. — stop executing the recipe. If the value for N is given, the contents of first N baking dishes will be printed.

Ingredient — variable. It is referenced by the name of the ingredient, its value is equal to the quantity of the ingredient, and the state of the ingredient (liquid, dry or unspecified) defines whether it will be printed as Unicode character (liquid) or as a number. All values are integer.
Mixing bowls and baking dishes — stacks which store integer values. All operations are done on values in mixing bowls. Baking dishes are used only to print the results. There can be plenty of both kinds of dish — if there are more than one of some kind, they are referred to by their indices (like “the second mixing bowl”).
