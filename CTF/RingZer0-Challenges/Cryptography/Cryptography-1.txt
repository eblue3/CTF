-- Some martian message --
# Caesar use secret code (aka: Caesar Cipher) which is "Shift" the origin Alphabet into shifted-Alphabet. Example: 
T1: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
T2:                                                                 abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

T1: Origin Alphabet to let you move T2 below to compare it.
T2: Shifted-Alphabet.

How-to-do: Look at the Encrypted-Message: There are "Pbby" which mean a word with 2 vowels
=> Moving the T2 and test until "PbbY" become a meaningful word. I have tried and luckily, got the "Cool" unshifted from "Pbby"
=> Write down the whole Encrypted-Message and try to solve it as below.
=> If fail (Decrypted-Message has no meaning) => Try again and again.
*Tips: "Pbby" is easy to find out in this case. You can look at other words if it has the same mechanism.

Solved:
Shifted-Alphabet:	nopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklm
Origin-Alphabet:	abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
