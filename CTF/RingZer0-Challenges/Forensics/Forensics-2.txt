RingZer0 Challenges:
[Forensics 2]
-- I'm sure it contain the matrix password! Can you find it? --

I have done a lots of works and then figure out it is ALL inside the file right in the beginnings ...
Let's get Started:

- Download the file, we receive a non-extension file called: 86b265d37d1fc10b721a2accae04a60d
=> Rename it to anything you want so we can easily work with it. I named it: "agentsmith"

- It is non-extension => I try to make it: txt, jpeg, png, gif, ... lots of extension but find out nothing there.
- TXT gives me a "matrix file" contains lots of number, no text or FLAG found.
- Then go to the next ones, I mount it to a media folder => Figure it contains 3 folder:
[root@*** Challenges]$ dlist
total 21K
drwxr-xr-x  9 root root 4.0K Jan  9 21:19  ..
drwxr-xr-x  5 root root 1.0K Feb  5  2014  .
drwxrwxrwx. 2 root root 1.0K Feb  5  2014 'to keep'
drwxrwxrwx  2 root root  12K Feb  4  2014  lost+found
drwxrwxrwx. 2 root root 1.0K Feb  5  2014  image
[root@*** Challenges]$ 

=> Go inside them, we found 3 pictures and 1 text files. I try to "cat" the content inside and find out it has a lots of strings inside them.
=> So I use command: 
[root@*** image]$ strings 01.jpeg | grep FLAG
[root@*** image]$ strings 02.jpeg | grep FLAG
[root@*** image]$ strings 03.jpg | grep FLAG
[root@*** to keep]$ strings 01.txt | grep FLAG
=> FOUND NOTHING !!!

So Back to the Start. It took me half an hour to find everything and try everything with those files but it's still a Zero result.

=> So I figure out, what if it's inside the original file only? Because the Title said "it".
=> I use:
[root@*** Downloads]$ strings agentsmith | grep FLAG
FLAG-ggmgk05096

BOOM !!!
