You're my only hope FLARE-On player! One of our developers was hacked and we're not sure what they took. We managed to set up a packet capture on the network once we found out but they were definitely already on the system. I think whatever they installed must be buggy - it looks like they crashed our developer box. We saved off the dump file but I can't make heads or tails of it - PLEASE HELP!!!!!!
